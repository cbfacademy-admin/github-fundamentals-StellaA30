A highly motivated individual with academic background in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence. After graduating my BSc, I gained work experience a Procurement Operation intern and an Assistant Accountant in the charity sector. However, I felt the need for a more challenging and exciting career that would allow me to leverage my problem solving and analytical skills.

With my newfound interest in coding, I felt compelled to pursue additional education and decided to undertake an MSc in Artificial Intelligence, which has reinforced my desire to pursue a career in technology. As someone who enjoys learning new things, the constant changes in the technology industry presents a unique opportunity to work on innovative projects and engage in continuous learning.
